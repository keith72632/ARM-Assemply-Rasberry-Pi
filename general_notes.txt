Number Systems:
	-binary (base 2)
		-each bit is 1^2*x. x increments one for every bit
		-usually prefixed with 0b
	-Hex (base 10)
		-123456789ABCDEF
		-each digit multiplies by 16^x. X is incremented for each digit
		-then add each digit together
		-usually prefixed with 0x
	-Assembly Tools
		-Assembly source code is "assembled" by ARM Assembler
			-sort of like al compiler
		-assembled into Object file
		-Linker used to create exectuable
	-Commands
		-differ from Intel and ARM
		-diff in 32 and 64 bit
		-ADD for add
		-STRH store hald word
		-B branch
	-Syntax
		-Instructions (lines) have 4 fields
			-label
				-optional. used to find position
			-opcode
				-specifies processor operation to perform
			-operand;
				-specifies source/dest of data to be processed
			-comment			
				optional
			-ex 
				-store_routine STR R0, [R1] ; comment

Arm Design and RISC philosohy:
		-RISC of Reduced Instuction Set Computer
			-used by ARM
		-CISC Complex Instuction Set Computer
			-Used by Intel
		-ARM tried to balance size and efficneicy of code 
	-Embeded devices consist of processor, controller, perpherals and
		a bus
		-two tyes of components connected to Bus
			-Bus master (processor)
			-Bus slave (peripherals)
		-two architecure levels
			-physical level
			-protocol level
		-bus architecture for AMR is AMBA, ASB, APB and AHB
			-AHB is high performace (higher clock frequencies)
	-Memory	
		-types
			-ROM (read-only mem)
			-Flash Rom (can be read and wrtiten)
			-Dram(dyanimc ram) is lowest cost per memory
			-SRAM(static ram) runs at higher clock rate
			-EEPROM(read and write)
		-flash 0x00000000
		-eeprom 0x00100000
		-sram 0x40000000
		-SFR(special function register) 0xFFFFFFFF
	-Peripherals
		-all are memory mapped
		-mem controller and interrupt controllers
	-Von Neumann Architecutree and Harvard Architecture
		
Programmers Model
	-Data Types
		-Byte = 8 bits
		-halfword = 16 bits
		-Word = 32 bits
	-ARM7TDMI Registers
		-a register is a storage inside of processor core
		-ARM have a number of register to perform processing and control
		-grouped in register bank
